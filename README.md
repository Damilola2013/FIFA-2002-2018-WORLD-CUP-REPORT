The ERD Model is a star Schema. There are four tables showing the entity, realtionships and Dax .which are a fact table,two dimension tables and Dax tables showing all the calculations and functions. The dimension table are all join to the fact table with a one-to-many reltionship.

We found that Germany had the highest games played, goals scored, and points accumulated, while Angola had the lowest performance in all categories. Additionally, we analyzed the performance of individual countries in each tournament year, identifying upward and downward trends for France and Nigeria.
